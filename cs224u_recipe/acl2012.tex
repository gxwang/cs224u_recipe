\begin{abstract}
  In this report, we present an approach to determining similarity between recipes using information extraction and collaborative filtering techniques.
Recipe similarity can be used to gain a functional understanding of what distinguishes different types of cuisine. Leveraging recipe data from the WikiBooks Cookbook\footnote{ http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook}, we can identify natural recipe classes using high-level user generated tags (e.g. "Indian Cuisine"). 
This report will describe various approaches to improving upon a baseline bag-of-words model.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Food often characterizes culture, and indeed, some cultures characterize themselves by their food. Anecdotally, we can make conjectures about cuisines that share close ties, but to what extent do recipes actually differ between these classifications? Thus, this report describes a system to compare recipe similarities within classes and across classes. We use the WikiBooks Cookbook data because it is freely available and is meta-tagged by users based on recipe characteristics. Some examples of recipe-wide tags are food categories like "bread recipes" and "fried recipes," as well as, cuisines like "Indian recipes" and "Chinese recipes." Thus, the WikiBooks Cookbook dataset includes both documents and the natural classes that include these documents. Recipes are interesting from a similarity metric point-of-view, becasue there may be some functional reasons for similarity and dis-similarity. For instance, bread recipes likely need flour and yeast. On the other hand, while Indian recipes and Mexican recipes both use spices, the cuisines have different flavor profiles precisely due to the specific spices that are commonly used.

The functional contribution of different ingredients to the flavor profie of a recipe highlights the signfiicance of information extraction for the recipe similarity task.  While bag-of-words alone can provide a useful baseline similarity score between recipes and class, information extraction on ingredients lists can capture more fine-grained information about the ingredient itself. Ingredients lists are generally short semi-structured phrases or fragments that include a base ingredient (e.g. onion), a unit of measurement and its quantity (e.g. 2 cups), and some properties (e.g. diced). However, simply running these lines through a parser doesn't provide a clean and consistent way of extracting these data, so there is plenty of room to improve extraction through hand-built features. Information extraction on ingredients lists can tease out functional information about the ingredients and their quantities.


\section{Methodology}

Manuscripts must be in two-column format. Exceptions to the two-column format include the title, 
authors' names and complete addresses, which must be centered at the top of the first page, 
and any full-width figures or tables (see the guidelines in Subsection~\ref{ssec:first}). {\bf Type single-spaced}. 
Start all pages directly under the top margin. See the guide-lines later regarding formatting the first page. Do not number the pages.

\subsection{Electronically-available resources}

ACL2012 provides this description in \LaTeX2e (acl2012.tex) and PDF format (acl2012.pdf), along with the LATEX2e style file used to format it (acl2012.sty) and an ACL bibliography style (acl.bst). These files are all available at \url{http://www.acl2012.org}.  A Microsoft Word template file (acl2012.dot) is also available at the same URL. We strongly recommend the use of these style files, which have been appropriately tailored for the ACL2012 proceedings. If you have an option, we recommend that you use the \LaTeX2e version. \textbf{If you will be using the Microsoft Word template, we suggest that you anonymize your source file so that the pdf produced does not retain your identity.} This can be done by removing any personal information from your source
document properties.


\subsection{Format of Electronic Manuscript}
\label{sect:pdf}

For the production of the electronic manuscript you must use Adobe's
Portable Document Format (PDF). This format can be generated from
postscript files: on Linux/Unix systems, you can use {\tt ps2pdf} for this
purpose; under Microsoft Windows, you can use Adobe's Distiller, or
if you have {\tt cygwin} installed, you can use {\tt dvipdf} or
{\tt ps2pdf}.  Note
that some word processing programs generate PDF which may not include
all the necessary fonts (esp. tree diagrams, symbols). When you print
or create the PDF file, there is usually an option in your printer
setup to include none, all or just non-standard fonts.  Please make
sure that you select the option of including ALL the fonts.  {\em Before sending it, test your PDF by printing it from a computer different from the one where it was created}. Moreover,
some word processor may generate very large postscript/PDF files,
where each page is rendered as an image. Such images may reproduce
poorly.  In this case, try alternative ways to obtain the postscript
and/or PDF.  One way on some systems is to install a driver for a
postscript printer, send your document to the printer specifying
``Output to a file'', then convert the file to PDF.

Additionally, it is of utmost importance to specify the {\bf US-Letter format} (8.5in $\times$ 11in) when formatting the paper. When working with {\tt dvips}, for instance, one should specify {\tt -t letter}.

Print-outs of the PDF file on US-Letter paper should be identical to the
hardcopy version.  If you cannot meet the above requirements about the
production of your electronic submission, please contact the
publication chair above as soon as possible.


\subsection{Layout}
\label{ssec:layout}

Format manuscripts two columns to a page, in the manner these
instructions are formatted. The exact dimensions for a page on US-letter
paper are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Left and right margins: 1in
\item Top margin:1in
\item Bottom margin: 1in
\item Column width: 3.15in
\item Column height: 9in
\item Gap between columns: 0.2in
\end{itemize}

\noindent Papers should not be submitted on any other paper size. If you cannot meet the above requirements about the production of your electronic submission, please contact the publication chair above as soon as possible.

\subsection{Fonts}

For reasons of uniformity, Adobe's {\bf Times Roman} font should be
used. In \LaTeX2e{} this is accomplished by putting

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage{latexsym}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
in the preamble. If Times Roman is unavailable, use {\bf Computer
  Modern Roman} (\LaTeX2e{}'s default).  Note that the latter is about
  10\% less dense than Adobe's Times Roman font.


\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|rl|}
\hline \bf Type of Text & \bf Font Size & \bf Style \\ \hline
paper title & 15 pt & bold \\
author names & 12 pt & bold \\
author affiliation & 12 pt & \\
the word ``Abstract'' & 12 pt & bold \\
section titles & 12 pt & bold \\
document text & 11 pt  &\\

abstract text & 10 pt & \\
bibliography & 10 pt & \\
footnotes & 9 pt & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{font-table} Font guide. }
\end{table}

\subsection{The First Page}
\label{ssec:first}

Center the title, author's name(s) and affiliation(s) across both
columns. Do not use footnotes for affiliations.  Do not include the
paper ID number assigned during the submission process.
Use the two-column format only when you begin the abstract.

{\bf Title}: Place the title centered at the top of the first page, in
a 15 point bold font.  (For a complete guide to font sizes and styles, see Table~\ref{font-table}.)
Long title should be typed on two lines without
a blank line intervening. Approximately, put the title at 1in from the
top of the page, followed by a blank line, then the author's names(s),
and the affiliation on the following line.  Do not use only initials
for given names (middle initials are allowed). Do not format surnames
in all capitals (e.g., ``Zhou,'' not ``ZHOU'').  The affiliation should
contain the author's complete address, and if possible an electronic
mail address. Leave about 0.75in between the affiliation and the body
of the first page. The title, author names and addresses should be completely identical to those entered to the electronic paper submission website in order to maintain the consistency of author information among all publications of the conference.

{\bf Abstract}: Type the abstract at the beginning of the first
column.  The width of the abstract text should be smaller than the
width of the columns for the text in the body of the paper by about
0.25in on each side.  Center the word {\bf Abstract} in a 12 point
bold font above the body of the abstract. The abstract should be a
concise summary of the general thesis and conclusions of the paper.
It should be no longer than 200 words. The abstract text should be in 10 point font.

{\bf Text}: Begin typing the main body of the text immediately after
the abstract, observing the two-column format as shown in
the present document. Do not include page numbers.

{\bf Indent} when starting a new paragraph. For reasons of uniformity,
use Adobe's {\bf Times Roman} fonts, with 11 points for text and
subsection headings, 12 points for section headings and 15 points for
the title.  If Times Roman is unavailable, use {\bf Computer Modern
  Roman} (\LaTeX2e's default; see section \ref{sect:pdf} above).
Note that the latter is about 10\% less dense than Adobe's Times Roman
font.

\subsection{Sections}

{\bf Headings}: Type and label section and subsection headings in the
style shown on the present document.  Use numbered sections (Arabic
numerals) in order to facilitate cross references. Number subsections
with the section number and the subsection number separated by a dot,
in Arabic numerals. Do not number subsubsections.

{\bf Citations}: Citations within the text appear
in parentheses as~\cite{Gusfield:97} or, if the author's name appears in
the text itself, as Gusfield~\shortcite{Gusfield:97}. Append lowercase letters to the year in cases of ambiguities. Treat double authors as in~\cite{Aho:72}, but write as in~\cite{Chandra:81} when more than two authors are involved. Collapse multiple citations as in~\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}. Also refrain from using full citations as sentence constituents. We suggest that instead of
\begin{quote}
  ``\cite{Gusfield:97} showed that ...''
\end{quote}
you use
\begin{quote}
``Gusfield \shortcite{Gusfield:97}   showed that ...''
\end{quote}

If you are using the provided \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files, you
can use the command \verb|\newcite| to get ``author (year)'' citations.

As reviewing will be double-blind, the submitted version of the papers should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that
reveal the author's identity, e.g.,
\begin{quote}
``We previously showed \cite{Gusfield:97} ...''
\end{quote}
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as
\begin{quote}
``Gusfield \shortcite{Gusfield:97}
previously showed ... ''
\end{quote}

Please do not  use anonymous
citations and  do not include acknowledgements when submitting your papers. Papers that do not conform
to these requirements may be rejected without review.

\textbf{References}: Gather the full set of references together under
the heading {\bf References}; place the section before any Appendices,
unless they contain references. Arrange the references alphabetically
by first author, rather than by order of occurrence in the text.
Provide as complete a citation as possible, using a consistent format,
such as the one for {\em Computational Linguistics\/} or the one in the
{\em Publication Manual of the American
Psychological Association\/}~\cite{APA:83}.  Use of full names for
authors rather than initials is preferred.  A list of abbreviations
for common computer science journals can be found in the ACM
{\em Computing Reviews\/}~\cite{ACM:83}.

The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly fit the
American Psychological Association format, allowing regular citations,
short citations and multiple citations as described above.

{\bf Appendices}: Appendices, if any, directly follow the text and the
references (but see above).  Letter them in sequence and provide an
informative title: {\bf Appendix A. Title of Appendix}.

\textbf{Acknowledgment} sections should go as a last section immediately
before the references. Do not number the acknowledgement section.

\subsection{Footnotes}

{\bf Footnotes}: Put footnotes at the bottom of the page. They may
be numbered or referred to by asterisks or other
symbols.\footnote{This is how a footnote should appear.} Footnotes
should be separated from the text by a line.\footnote{Note the
line separating the footnotes from the text.}  Footnotes should be in 9 point font.

\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the
paper near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if
possible.  Wide illustrations may run across both columns and should be placed at
the top of a page. Color illustrations are discouraged, unless you have verified that
they will be understandable when printed in black ink.

{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each one
sequentially in the form:  ``Figure 1. Caption of the Figure.'' ``Table 1.
Caption of the Table.''  Type the captions of the figures and
tables below the body, using 10 point text.

\section{Translation of non-English Terms}

It is also advised to supplement non-English characters and terms
with appropriate transliterations and/or translations
since not all readers understand all such characters and terms.

Inline transliteration or translation can be represented in
the order of: original-form transliteration ``translation''.

\section{Length of Submission}
\label{sec:length}

Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content and an
additional two (2) pages of references, and short papers may consist
of up to four (4) pages of content and two (2) additional pages of
references.  Papers that do not conform to the specified length and
formatting requirements are subject to re-submission.

\section{Other Issues}
 
Those papers that had software and/or dataset submitted for the review process, should also submit it 
with the camera-ready paper. Besides, the software and/or dataset should not be anonymous. 

Please note that the publications of ACL2012 will be publicly available at ACL Anthology 
(http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/) on July 2nd, 2012, one week before the start of the conference. 
Since some of the authors may have plans to file patents related to their papers in the conference, 
we are sending this reminder that July 2nd, 2012 may be considered to be the official publication date, 
instead of the opening day of the conference.
