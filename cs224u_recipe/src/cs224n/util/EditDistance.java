/**
   * An edit distance is a measure of difference between two sentences.  We
   * assume that one sentence can be transformed into another through a
   * sequence of INSERT, DELETE, and SUBSTITUTE operations, each costing 1
   * unit.  For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumped over the
   * lazy dog." can be transformed into the sentence "The fox tripped over
   * the fat lazy dog." using 2 DELETEs, 1 SUBSTITUTE, and 1 INSERT, for a
   * cost of 4.  In general, given two sentences, there are multiple
   * sequences of operations which transform the first sentence into the
   * second; the edit distance is defined to be the cost of the
   * <i>cheapest</i> such sequence.
