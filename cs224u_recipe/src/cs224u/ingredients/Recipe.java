	 * So I am thinking that we need the following things from the recipe class:
	 * - plaintext
	 * - labeled data if possible
	 * - containers for all of the labels
	 * 
	 * But I am not sure if we want to read recipes streaming, or if we should load everything into memory?
	 * I think this will depend on how big this class gets/whether or not we using this class.
